    name: "Shri Dilip Kumar Roy - Dadaji",
    details: `Dilip Kumar Roy (January 22, 1897—January 6, 1980) was a famous poet, author, singer, composer,
    lyricist, musicologist and dramatist and son of Dwijendralal Roy. After graduating with first class
    honors in mathematics from Presidency College (Kolkata) he left for England in 1919 to pursue
    higher studies in mathematics and music at Cambridge. In 1922 he went to Germany to study
    Western music and commenced an international tour (visiting Lugano, Vienna, Prague, Budapest,
    and other cities) where he lectured on Indian music and culture. Following his return to India, he
    established himself as a popular singer and composer, making many musical innovations and
    synthesizing the Indian and Western musical traditions.<br/><br/>
    
    Sri D.K. Roy's spiritual life started with his deep devotion to Sri Ramakrishna in his boyhood. As a
    boy and young man, he received blessings from Sri Ramakrishna's direct disciples, Sri M and Swami
    Brahmananda. Following his return to India after his stay in Europe, he first met Sri Aurobindo in
    January 1924 and interviewed him twice (documented in "Among the Great"). On November 22,
    1928, he left his material possessions and musical career to join the Sri Aurobindo Ashram and
    dedicate his life and his art fully to the Lord. It was during this phase of his life that he first met
    Janak Kumari (later initiated as Indira Devi), who Sri Aurobindo advised he accept as his disciple.
    Following Sri Aurobindo's mahasamadhi, he left the Sri Aurobindo Ashram in 1953 and settled in
    Pune where he set up his own Ashram, the Hari Krishna Mandir. It was here that he continued his
    sadhana, writing, and soul-stirring music, inspiring numerous people through his all-embracing love,
    his commitment to truth, and his single-pointed devotion.<br/><br/>
    
    Sri D.K. Roy was a prolific artist and author. His published works spanned numerous genres,
    including prose, poetry, and drama in English and Bengali. His works include The Flute Calls
    Still, Smriticharan, Sri Aurobindo Came To Me, Among the Great, Yogi Sri Krishnaprem, Hark! His Flute, The
    Upward Spiral, Netaji: The Man, Pilgrims of the Stars, The Beggar Princess, Aghotan Ajo Ghate (Miracles Do
    Still Happen), Ashruhashi Indradhanu, Chayapather Pathik, Alochaya Akapakhi, Smriti Joware Dukul Cheye,
    and others. For his musical and literary attainments, he received the title of "Sursudhakar" from
    Sanskrit College, Kolkata, a D.Litt from the University of Calcutta and Rabindra Bharati University,
    and was designated a Cultural Ambassador of India in 1953. India's National Academy for Music,
    Dance and Drama, awarded him its highest honour for lifetime achievement, the Sangeet Natak
    Akademi Fellowship in 1965. He attained mahasamadhi on January 6, 1980.<br/><br/>

    name: "Indira Devi - Ma",
    details: `As Janak Kumari in her pre-initiated life, Indira Devi was born into a family of wealth, culture, and
    social privilege. Drawn by an irresistible urge to seek something more profound, more real, and
    more fulfilling than the material pursuits and opportunities offered by a pampered life, she turned to
    her Guru Sri Dilip Kumar Roy, the great illuminate and a disciple of Sri Aurobindo <br/><br/>
  
    At her Guru's feet, she renounced all material riches and the human attachments of her mind and
    heart without hesitation. She dismissed the most coveted aspirations of worldly life as pleasant
    irrelevances. She sought the Divine with one-pointed devotion.<br/><br/>
    
    The intensity and sincerity of her quest were such that she attained the highest of spiritual
    experiences easily. She entered savikalpa samadhi where one experiences a state of absorption in a
    blissful trance with a clear self-vision of universal oneness, in her initial days of sadhana (or practice.
    Before long, Indira Devi had the rare nirvikalpa samadhi i.e., complete ego-extinction in Divine
    Union about three times; and Bhava Samadhi— a mystical state where one revels absorbed and
    nestled in Divine Love, frequently till the end of her physical life in 1997 at the age of seventy
    seven.<br/><br/>
    
    Yet, Indira Devi was not attached to the stellar, rarefied spiritual experiences mentioned above. She
    maintained equanimity and remained grounded in this life despite hearing the rapturous Krishna's
    celestial flute notes numerous times. Under the guise of serving her Guru, Indira Devi chose to
    serve the whole world with a pure and all-absolving heart. Assuming the attitude of a helpless child
    of her Guru, she hid her strengths. She paid the karmic debt of her children (i.e., of the world) under
    the guise of her own illness. Fellow devotees and disciples fondly called her Ma (mother in Hindi).<br/><br/>
    
    Indira Devi composed more than a thousand Mira bhajans (of which Shrutanjali is a part) by
    becoming a medium of the great medieval woman mystic Mira-Bai in her trance states. These are
    prayer songs like the songs of the Sufi and bhakti mystics. They elucidate the "path of the heart," a
    sacred yet perilous journey that demands the scaling of sublime peaks and struggling through lonely
    valleys and dark nights, and all the while offering guidance and counsel for sincere spiritual seekers
    inspired to follow her.<br/><br/>
    
    Indira Devi's Mira bhajans allow the readers and listeners to glimpse the highest mystic interfaces
    between human being and God. They describe what a human heart might experience when it
    approaches the grand continuum between dualistic and non-dualistic states of consciousness.
    Though the Bhajans depict the Vaishnava tradition's way of Bhakti, the emotions are valid for the
    followers of any mystical path.<br/><br/>
    
    Indira Devi emphasized using the essential roles of the power of truth, purity, and humility in self-
    transformation. She advocated faith as a supra-rational tool through which man gains spiritual<br/><br/>
    
    knowledge. She believed the highest Love, Prema, was not possible without them.<br/><br/>
    
    Like the mountain guides of the high Himalayas leading the most daring and dedicated of
    mountaineers to the highest peaks on earth, Indira Devi (and other God-realized masters) continues
    to guide the committed among us along the mystical journeys we choose to undertake. Shedding our
    lesser nature, learning to ascend to a higher consciousness, and wanting to attain our inner summits
    form the crux of that commitment.<br/><br/>
    
    Ma's Love for the world was for all, humans and animals alike. To an onlooker, the ferocity of her
    Love reminded one of the Divine Mother Kālī herself in action; or witnessing the passion of the
    Christ. She practiced Sri Aurobindo's Supramental Yoga in silence, hiding in plain sight amidst common
    people. And yet, she shared (and continues to share) the fruits of her hard-fought labor and
    unmeasured sacrifice with the whole world unreservedly.<br/><br/>
    
    With the most profound reverence to Ma Indira Devi, whose luminous life as a woman mystic and
    human being leads our way through Love, Purity, Grace, and one pointed devotion to the Divine,
    we offer this work at her feet.<br/><br/>
