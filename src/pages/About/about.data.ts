    name: 'Shri Dilip Kumar Roy - Dadaji',
    details: `Dilip Kumar Roy (January 22, 1897—January 6, 1980) was a famous poet, author, singer, composer,
    lyricist, musicologist and dramatist and son of Dwijendralal Roy. After graduating with first class
    honors in mathematics from Presidency College (Kolkata) he left for England in 1919 to pursue
    higher studies in mathematics and music at Cambridge. In 1922 he went to Germany to study
    Western music and commenced an international tour (visiting Lugano, Vienna, Prague, Budapest,
    and other cities) where he lectured on Indian music and culture. Following his return to India, he
    established himself as a popular singer and composer, making many musical innovations and
    synthesizing the Indian and Western musical traditions.
    Sri D.K. Roy's spiritual life started with his deep devotion to Sri Ramakrishna in his boyhood. As a
    boy and young man, he received blessings from Sri Ramakrishna's direct disciples, Sri M and Swami
    Brahmananda. Following his return to India after his stay in Europe, he first met Sri Aurobindo in
    January 1924 and interviewed him twice (documented in "Among the Great"). On November 22,
    1928, he left his material possessions and musical career to join the Sri Aurobindo Ashram and
    dedicate his life and his art fully to the Lord. It was during this phase of his life that he first met
    Janak Kumari (later initiated as Indira Devi), who Sri Aurobindo advised he accept as his disciple.
    Following Sri Aurobindo's mahasamadhi, he left the Sri Aurobindo Ashram in 1953 and settled in
    Pune where he set up his own Ashram, the Hari Krishna Mandir. It was here that he continued his
    sadhana, writing, and soul-stirring music, inspiring numerous people through his all-embracing love,
    his commitment to truth, and his single-pointed devotion.
    Sri D.K. Roy was a prolific artist and author. His published works spanned numerous genres,
    including prose, poetry, and drama in English and Bengali. His works include The Flute CallsStill, Smriticharan, Sri Aurobindo Came To Me, Among the Great, Yogi Sri Krishnaprem, Hark! His Flute, The
    Upward Spiral, Netaji: The Man, Pilgrims of the Stars, The Beggar Princess, Aghotan Ajo Ghate (Miracles Do
    Still Happen), Ashruhashi Indradhanu, Chayapather Pathik, Alochaya Akapakhi, Smriti Joware Dukul Cheye,
    and others. For his musical and literary attainments, he received the title of "Sursudhakar" from
    Sanskrit College, Kolkata, a D.Litt from the University of Calcutta and Rabindra Bharati University,
    and was designated a Cultural Ambassador of India in 1953. India's National Academy for Music,
    Dance and Drama, awarded him its highest honour for lifetime achievement, the Sangeet Natak
    Akademi Fellowship in 1965. He attained mahasamadhi on January 6, 1980.

    name: 'Indria Devi - Ma',
    details: `As Janak Kumari in her pre-initiated life, Indira Devi was born to wealth and led an affluent family
    life. Drawn by an irresistible urge to seek something more profound, more significant, more real,
    and much more fulfilling than the material things she had, she turned to her Guru Sri Dilip Kumar
    Roy, the great illuminate and a disciple of Sri Aurobindo.
    At her Guru's feet, she renounced all material riches and the human attachments of her mind and
    heart without hesitation. She dismissed the most coveted traits of human eminence as pleasant
    irrelevances. She sought the Divine with one-pointed devotion.
    The intensity of her quest and sincerity was such that she had the highest of spiritual experiences
    easily. She had the Savikalpa Samadhi experience where one experiences a state of absorption in a
    blissful trance with a clear self-vision, in her initial days of Sadhana (or practice). Indira Devi had the
    rare Nirvikalpa Samadhi i.e., complete ego-extinction about three times; and Bhava Samadhi— a
    mystical state of mind where one revels absorbed and nestled in the Divine Love, frequently till the
    end of her physical life in 1997 at the age of seventy seven.
    Indira Devi was not bound attached to the stellar, rarefied spiritual experiences mentioned above.
    She maintained equanimity and remained grounded despite hearing the rapturous Krishna's celestial
    flute notes numerous times. Under the guise of serving her Guru, Indira Devi chose to serve the
    whole world with a pure and all-absolving heart. Assuming the attitude of being a helpless child of
    her Guru, she hid her strengths. She paid the karmic debt of her children (i.e., of the world) under
    the guise of her own illness. Fellow devotees and disciples fondly called her Ma (mother in Hindi).
    Indira Devi composed more than a thousand Mira bhajans (of which Shrutanjali is a part) by being a
    medium of the great medieval woman mystic Mira-Bai in her trance states. These are prayer songs
    like the songs of the Sufi mystics. They elucidate the "path of the heart," its pits, peaks, travails, tips,
    guidance, and tricks for sincere spiritual seekers.
    Indira Devi's Mira bhajans draw interest and allow the readers and listeners to glimpse the highest
    mystic interfaces between man and God. The bhajans also describe what a human heart might
    experience when it courts the vicinities of the grand continuum between dualistic and non-dualisticstates of consciousness. Though the Bhajans depict the Vaishnava tradition's way of Bhakti, the
    emotions are valid for the followers of any mystical path.
    Indira Devi emphasized using the essential roles of the power of truth, purity, and humility in self-
    transformation. She advocated faith as a supra-rational tool through which man gains spiritual
    knowledge. She believed the highest Love, Prema, was not possible without them.
    Like the mountain guides of the high Himalayas leading the most daring and dedicated of
    mountaineers to the peaks they aspire to climb, Indira Devi (and many of her peer God-realized
    masters) continue to guide the committed among us through the mystical journeys we choose to
    undertake. Shedding our lesser nature, learning to ascend to a higher consciousness, and wanting to
    attain our inner summits form the crux of that commitment.
    Ma's Love for the world was indiscriminate-to humans and animals alike. To an onlooker, the
    ferocity of her Love reminded one of the Divine Mother herself in action; or witnessing the passion
    of the Christ. She practiced Sri Aurobindo's Supramental Yoga in silence, hiding in society's plain sight
    amidst common people. And yet, she shared (and continues to share) the fruits of her hard-fought
    labor and unmeasured sacrifice with the whole world unreservedly.
    With the most profound reverence to Ma Indira Devi, whose luminous life as one of the greatest
    great woman mystics and an example human being leads our way through her Love, Purity, Grace,
    and one pointed devotion to the Divine we offer this work at her feet.
